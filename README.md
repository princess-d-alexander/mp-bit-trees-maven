# mp-bit-trees-maven

A mini-project exploring bit trees (a form of binary tree) and their use in translating between alphabets, particularly in translating to and from braille.

## Assignment Overview

This assignment is adapted from the **Including A11y in CS** project, entitled **"Braille Binary Tree"**. The goal of this assignment is to implement a binary tree that can store mappings between Braille bit sequences and their corresponding ASCII and Unicode values. This project will deepen your understanding of binary trees and provide practical experience in handling bit sequences, as well as converting between Braille, ASCII, and Unicode systems.

### Project Details

- **Project Title:** Braille Binary Tree
- **Course:** CSC 207 - Data Structures

## Objectives

* Implement a binary tree structure that can handle Braille-to-ASCII and Braille-to-Unicode conversions.
* Ensure proper validation of input and tree traversal.
* Provide functionality to set, get, and manipulate the tree of Braille mappings.
* Handle errors gracefully, especially when converting bit sequences to ASCII or Unicode values.
* Write clear, understandable Java code that adheres to proper style guidelines.

## Instructions

**Assignment Tasks**:
    * Implement the `set()` method to add Braille bit sequences and their corresponding ASCII/Unicode values to the binary tree.
    * Implement the `get()` method to retrieve ASCII/Unicode values given a Braille bit sequence.
    * Handle bit sequence validation (only '0' and '1' are valid characters).
    * Ensure proper error handling when a sequence is not found or has been improperly formed.
